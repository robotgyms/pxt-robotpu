 # 🔁 Lesson: Event Loop (Observation → Thinking → Action)
 
 Robot programs are not “one command then stop”. They run continuously.
 
 On micro:bit MakeCode, the common programming model is an **event loop**:
 
 - you register event handlers (buttons, radio, gestures)
 - you run repeated logic in `basic.forever(...)`
 - the runtime schedules these pieces so your program can *multitask*
 
 This is the foundation for the Robot PU pattern:
 
 **Observation → Thinking → Action**

 ## 1. What is an event loop?
 
 An **event loop** is a program structure where:
 
 - the system waits for events
 - runs your code for a short time
 - returns control back to the runtime
 - repeats forever
 
 In MakeCode:
 
 - `basic.forever(function () { ... })` is your “main loop”
 - `input.onButtonPressed(...)` are event callbacks
 
 The key rule is:
 
 - **do small work, then return** (don’t block forever)

 ## 2. Observation → Thinking → Action
 
 A robust robot control loop looks like this:
 
 ### A. Observation (sense)
 
 Read sensors:
 
 - `robotPu.sonarDistanceCm()`
 - `input.isGesture(Gesture.FreeFall)`
 - `input.rotation(Rotation.Roll)` / `input.rotation(Rotation.Pitch)`
 - `input.soundLevel()`
 
 ### B. Thinking (decide)
 
 Compute what to do next:
 
 - obstacle? slow down / turn
 - falling? stop / stand
 - loud beat? dance
 
 ### C. Action (act)
 
 Send one small action update:
 
 - `robotPu.walk(speed, turn)`
 - `robotPu.explore()`
 - `robotPu.stand()`
 
 Then loop back.

 ## 3. Why async (non-blocking) actions are important
 
 Robot PU motion APIs are designed to be **called repeatedly**.
 
 Each call advances the motion a little bit (servo stepping). This style is “async” in the sense that:
 
 - you do not call one function and wait for the whole walk to finish
 - instead, you keep calling it in the event loop
 
 Benefits:
 
 - buttons still work
 - radio still receives messages
 - sensor checks still run
 - you can interrupt / change behavior instantly
 
 If you write a long blocking loop (or a function that never returns), you can starve the rest of the system.

 ## 4. Why the event loop is critical for multitasking
 
 Multitasking on micro:bit is not “real threads” like a PC. It’s cooperative scheduling:
 
 - your code runs
 - you return control
 - the runtime runs other tasks/events
 
 So you should avoid:
 
 - long-running blocking functions
 - very heavy computation inside `forever`
 
 Instead:
 
 - keep each loop iteration short
 - use state variables
 - let the event loop run many times per second

 ## 5. Example: a clean observation-thinking-action loop
 
 This example:
 
 - observes sonar distance
 - decides a turn direction
 - acts by calling one motion update
 
 ```typescript
 basic.forever(function () {
     // 1) Observation
     const cm = robotPu.sonarDistanceCm()
 
     // 2) Thinking
     let speed = 2
     let turn = 0
 
     if (cm > 0 && cm < 15) {
         speed = -2
         turn = 0.8
     }
 
     // 3) Action (one small update)
     robotPu.walk(speed, turn)
 })
 ```
 
 ---
 
 ## 6. Example: using events to change robot “mode”
 
 Use buttons to switch between behaviors, while the main loop keeps running.
 
 ```typescript
 enum Mode {
     Stand,
     Explore,
     Walk
 }
 
 let mode = Mode.Stand
 
 input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
     mode = Mode.Explore
 })
 
 input.onButtonPressed(Button.B, function () {
     mode = Mode.Walk
 })
 
 input.onButtonPressed(Button.AB, function () {
     mode = Mode.Stand
 })
 
 basic.forever(function () {
     if (mode == Mode.Stand) {
         robotPu.stand()
     } else if (mode == Mode.Explore) {
         robotPu.explore()
     } else {
         robotPu.walk(2, 0)
     }
 })
 ```

 ## 7. Checklist for good robot event loops
 
 - **Keep loop iterations short**
 - **Use state variables** (mode, counters, timers)
 - **React to events** (buttons/sensors) instead of blocking waits
 - **Call motion actions repeatedly** instead of trying to “finish the whole motion” in one call
